  <mark>WHAT IS A FEMBOY?<aniemothirteen></aniemothirteen></mark>

  Hard question innit, but hopefully scrounging around all these definitions you'll figure it out. And i don't
  want to push you into believing my own opinion of what a femboy is yet to come to a conclusion of your own
  from multiple sources. <aniemotwelve></aniemotwelve>

  <smark>Opinions on the Defintion of Femboys by Femboys</smark>

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fingamouse" target="_blank">u/fingamouse</a> (site creator) - if you want my opinion on the definition of a femboy, a femboy is a person
  who identifies as male and dresses and or acts feminine (wearing usually thigh highs and a skirt), usually
  young not to be confused with ladyboys and being a femboy isn't the same as being a cross dresser as
  femboys try to dress as cute feminine boys; not cute girls and being a femboy isn't necessarily
  LGBT but there's a sizeable overlap.

  anonymous - A traditional femboy is a male who presents himself in a feminine matter, such as demeanor,
  choice of clothing, or anything that can be considered feminine but a universal defintion of a femboy is
  a person who presents themselves in a feminine matter whether it's through demeanor, clothing,
  makeup or hobbies. Despite the word "boy" being present, It's a self-identify title that anyone
  can identify themselves to whether the person identifies themselves as a boy or not.

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ILiekBenz/" target="_blank">u/ILiekBenz</a> - just a person who is a guy that likes to dress fem

  jesper - I would define it as someone who identifies as a male or potentially being non-binary  (either AMAB
  or FTM),  who wishes to present themselves in a characteristically feminine manner. Similar to how a tomboy
  would present themselves in a more masculine manner. It is ultimately a way of self expression and doesn’t
  indicate things like gender identity, sexuality etc.

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Oh_look_a_femboy_alt/" target="_blank">u/Oh_look_a_femboy_alt</a> a feminine dude, who wants to identify as a femboy. usually gay/bi/pan but can be
  straight. body type/size is not a factor, its a personal decision.

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/owensfem/" target="_blank">u/owensfem</a> - Okay so the way I interpret a femboy is not just a person who identifies as male dressing in
  female clothing but so much more it’s really well it’s a community of people who all do it and are all
  super supportive nice and welcoming people

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Snakooooooooo" target="_blank">u/Snakooooooooo</a> - Well i just see it like night and day, Guy wear girl clothes = femboy,
  Girl wear guy clothes = tomboy, (better sounding as tomgirl) But being a femboy is just a person
  who dresses or acts very feminine to me

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/paprino_27" target="_blank">u/paprino_27</a> - I think that a femboy is a person who presents themselves as feminine and/or likes to appear
  and dress feminine, in public or in private settings while not being  biologically a female (so pretty
  much I think that only cis girls can't really be femboys) I think it's a pretty fair definition

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/skye_diamonds" target="_blank">u/skye_diamonds</a> - A femboy is a boy who wears traditionally feminine things, or acts
  in ways that are associated with femininity
  
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hoobleer" target="_blank">u/Hoobleer</a> - I generally think that "Femboy" is a term that refers to pretty much anyone, however typically used by 
  those assigned male at birth, who express some feminine traits in their appearance/behavior/fashion choice/ etc. Regardless of gender anyone who says they are a femboy should be classed
  as one, as expression of femininity can vary widely.

  but if you want to give your opinion message me

  <smark>What Does Being a Femboy Mean to You?</smark>

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fingamouse" target="_blank">u/fingamouse</a> (site creator) - to me its wearing cute skirts and thighs and feeling cute and comfortable in
  cute looking clothes

  anonymous - one of part of being a femboy is how in a way it expands the possibilities of expression and
  Part of being a femboy is about exploring one's identity and figuring out what means you comfortable

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ILiekBenz/" target="_blank">u/ILiekBenz</a> - i guess Its just like presenting myself in a feminine matter

  jesper - For me it’s just getting to be myself and not feel like spending my life pretending to be
  someone else to meet their expectations.

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Oh_look_a_femboy_alt/" target="_blank">u/Oh_look_a_femboy_alt</a> well thats kinda the same as my definition imo being a dude or non binary who
  presents as a feminine guy

  <a href="hhttps://www.reddit.com/user/owensfem/" target="_blank">u/owensfem</a> - Being a femboy is being part of a really supportive and wonderful community  of like
  minded adorable boys! And when I dress up I feel a sense of joy every single time.

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Snakooooooooo" target="_blank">u/Snakooooooooo</a> - everything

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/paprino_27" target="_blank">u/paprino_27</a> - It's a way to express myself and my feelings about some of the things that
  I think or am, and it helped, and still helps, me a lot to make me accept my sexuality
  and accept myself for who I really am in general

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/skye_diamonds" target="_blank">u/skye_diamonds</a> - It means I can look cute, I just do it because I think it makes me look attractive

  <mark>FEMBOY STORIES</mark>

  heres some storys told by fellow femboys

  <smark>BECOMING A FEMBOY STORIES</smark>

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fingamouse" target="_blank">u/fingamouse</a> (site creator) - one day on reddit & i saw a picture of a pre-transition male to female
  trans girl, & i was kind of amazed at how feminine a person who has had no surgery or drugs or whatever
  could look. Then i joined <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/femboy/" target="_blank">r/femboy</a> cause i wanted to see stuff a little like that more, & i had
  seen memes about femboys before, & man seeing all these cute ass boys every single day, it just
  made me think "man i want to be cute like that". I asked my mum questions like "hey i want to buy some
  clothing but im to scared to ask", and she would try to guess and it was a fun way to get to know how
  she would feel about me wearing certain clothes. My mum had said in the past "i wouldnt mind you wearing
  a dress you'd just have to look good", and i knew a skirt is kinda like a dress. I knew if i asked my mum 
  for a skirt she would be fine with it but i was still really scared and eventually instead i asked my mum
  if i could get a  "private drawer", where she wouldn't be able to look into it, and she said something like
  "fine you deserve that kinda privacy at your age just nothing illegal", and she asked a little bit guessing
  what i wanted to put in there. But in the end trying to find a seller to buy a skirt from and trying to
  guarantee that the seller would sell me the skirt in discreet packaging i gave up and just asked my mum. My
  mum was cool, after i found out i was too chubby to actually fit into any of the skirts i wanted so
  that was a bit of a slap in the face to me becoming a femboy but i worked out lost the weight
  and eventually got my first skirt and i have been a femboy ever since

  anonymous - When I was on my trip to Mexico, my little cousin want to practice her makeup skills but have
  no one other than me to practice on. I was bored at the time so I reluctantly agree to help. My cousin
  asked what makeup style do i pick, I wanted something simple and didn't require a lot of products. My
  cousin use a red liner or something to draw out the blushing effect around the middle lower half of my
  face and drew some cat whiskers around my cheeks. After she finished and shown me a mirror, something
  is inside must have awaken, its like the strange feeling of uncertainty & a bit of thrill to it. But
  most importantly, I felt cute asf <aniemotwentytwo></aniemotwentytwo> (I had a picture of it but was lost on the other phone) At that
  time I was thinking about being a femboy and it was not more than a thought that will fade away,
  however because of that, I was determined to become a femboy when I get home. I bought my first
  ever thigh highs when I got home ○w○

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ILiekBenz/" target="_blank">u/ILiekBenz</a> - the thing that made it all happen was like when I scrolled aliexpress for stuff and stumbled upon
  a cute outfit then it all made sense to me. Like I saw that outfit and I really wanted to get it. It was a
  maid outfit lol

  jesper - To be blunt I would describe my life up till 19-20 years old as being completely
  repressed and not having ever explored who I am. When I met my girlfriend we originally had
  a relationship that by the expectations of society was relatively normal. Over time she
  encourage me to be more expressive and help me explore who I am, I can’t exactly pin it
  down but it was thanks to her that I slowly learnt more about myself till I realised I was a
  Femboy.

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Oh_look_a_femboy_alt/" target="_blank">u/Oh_look_a_femboy_alt</a> - i ran into i think r/femboy (the sfw one) and i got like gender envy maybe idk
  what it would be called maybe like apperance envy

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Snakooooooooo" target="_blank">u/Snakooooooooo</a> - I was pure pressured, and also when everyone all your life tells you not to do one thing, you
  proceed to do it, despite how I became one, I love being one.. I went from like a ghost
  in people's minds to now i actually get acknowledged :3

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/paprino_27" target="_blank">u/paprino_27</a> - It was June 2022 and I just accepted that I also liked boys and thought femboys were really cool
  and cute, I had my mind opened to new experiences and I was really curious and I always had a big
  feminine side in me since I was very young so I thought why not try, I found some sort of high socks
  I had and I liked them a lot and felt comfortable in them so I continued and I'm very grateful that
  I did. I love the community and it helped me a lot understanding myself, I'm very happy I took this choice

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/skye_diamonds" target="_blank">u/skye_diamonds</a> - When I realized I was bi, I started frequenting r/teenfemboys because I thought the guys
  were cute, then I realized I had the perfect body type for it, then I just decided to try it for fun.

  <smark>MISCELLANEOUS FEMBOY STORIES</smark>

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fingamouse" target="_blank">u/fingamouse</a> (site creator) - getting my first skirt it was ordered online and
  when i got it it was euphoric putting it on. But i soon reaslised it was to big for me, my mum asked if i
  wanted to return it but the joy i had getting my first skirt overpowered my annouyance on it not fitting.
  So i kept it and it still have it today, but nower days i can only wear it with a belt holding it
  to my body.

  <mark>CLOTHING IDEAS / INFO</mark>

  There is no one femboy look or outfit but here are some types of clothing that i feel define the femboy
  aesthetic or are just plain cute! Here are some suggestions & ideas you could think about. <aniemotwenty></aniemotwenty>

  <smark>Thigh Highs/Stockings</smark> - there adorable and an essential for your average femboy & come in a huge variety of
  colours. now how are thigh garter possible well <a href="#A9">[1]</a> in 1959 the pretty polly tights company 
  based in Nottingham England created hold-ups meaning people could wear thigh highs with them falling down 
  creating preety much thigh highs in thigh highs there being an elastic band that would hold them up <a href="#A9">[2]</a> but
  around the 1960s thigh highs took a back seat for women because there skirts became more shorter meaning 
  tights became more in favour for women and after that i dont know when they came back into fashion, but
  they eventually did and thank astolfo they did.

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/Thigh_High.png" style="width:500px;height:469px;margin-left: 23px">
 
  now regarding how to fold up and store your thigh highs theres many ways to fold up thigh highs
  but heres one of them my mum taught me i feel is intuiative and easy hopefully the video
  is self explanitory whats the method called idk but i call it the carrot top method
	<table style="width:69%;margin-left: 23px;border: transparent ;margin-left: 23px;">
   <tr>
	  <th style="width:1%;border: transparent ;margin-left: 23px;"></th>
    <th style="width:90%;border: transparent ;margin-left: 23px;"></th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td style="width:1%;border: transparent ;margin-left: 23px;"> <video width="271.2" height="432" controls> <source src="videos/thigh-high-fold.mp4" type="video/mp4" </video></video> </td>
    <td style="width:1%;border: transparent ;margin-left: 23px;"> <img src="General_Images/carrot_top_thigh_high_pic.JPG" style="width:324px;height:432px;"> </td>
  </tr>
	
	<style>
table, th, td {
  border: transparent ;margin-left: 23px;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  }
  </style>

	</table>
  <smark>Skirts</smark> - they are adorable and by law you must give a skirt a big spin the second you put one on for
  the first time or lord astolfo will banish you to hell, a place where skirts & stockings do not exist!
  With skirts its best to keep them hanged up some the pleats dont get screwed up at least thats what
  my mum said and it seems most site agree with her.

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/Skirts.png" style="width:449px;height:460px;margin-left: 23px">

  <smark>Chokers</smark> - man trying these on for the first time they don't call em chokers for nothing! <aniemotwentyone></aniemotwentyone> But
  there a super cute thingy to add onto your fit. But if your a closeted femboy be warned if you put them
  on to tight they can leave in imprint & then your cover could be blown so be careful!

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/Chockers.png" style="width:500px;height:477px;margin-left: 23px">

  <smark>Thigh garter</smark> - for a long time i never knew the word for this cute piece of clothing. But when i saw one
  i was in love! <aniemotwentytwo></aniemotwentytwo> if you hate your thigh highs falling down get some thigh garter to hold them up plus
  they look super cute. But be warned at least in my experience they lead to some of my thigh highs breaking much
  quicker.

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/thigh_garter.jpg" style="width:597px;height:598px;margin-left: 23px">

  <smark>Fish nets</smark> - they are really cute but there a battle to put on & break so easily but man there cute.

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/Fishnets.png" style="width:450px;height:585px;margin-left: 23px">

  <smark>Tights</smark> - if you want something more conservative then thigh highs & a soft different texture try out tights.

  <smark>Gym shorts</smark> - a cute piece of the femboy aesthetic gym shorts can be added to any femboy fit.
  if your wearing boxers with them you may have to scrunch them up a bit because they will show
  when your wearing the shorts or wear something like panties.

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/gym_shorts.jpg" style="width:495px;height:758px;margin-left: 23px">

  <smark>Maid outfits</smark> - a femboys dream the maid outfit oh lord astolfo the cuteness this outfit has and embodies.

  <smark>XL clothing</smark> - now some may disagree with me here but a huge T-shirt or comfy hoodie can be a great part of a
  femboy fit.

  <smark>Wrist Warmers</smark> - Wrist warmers can be a little cute addition to femboy fit. they may make moving your hands a
  bit hard but ehh no pain no gain innit. and some can be comfortable and they are cute.

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/wrist_warmers.png" style="margin-left: 23px">

  <smark>Cat Ears</smark> - a cute piece of clothing & no! its not furry id say its neko but ehh cat ears are cute. (:
  issues you may have with them is keeping them on your head they can easily fall of and so far i 
  haven't found a good solution to this
	
 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/cat_ears.png" style="width:538px;height:646px;margin-left: 23px">

  <smark>Belt</smark> - a belt can smothen out your waistline & bring more attention to your boy tum.

  <smark>Crop top</smark> - if you've got pride of your boy tum if you want to you can wear a crop top hoodie or T-shirt
  to show it off.

  <smark>Mask</smark> - if your not a big fan of your face then covering it up with a mask may make you feel more confident
  i am British so i can related<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpUSKE9p_M" target="_blank">.</a>

  <smark>Jewellery</smark> - some cute dangly earrings or some big hoops can but super cute to a femboy fit.

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/Hair_Clips.png" style="width:425px;height:417px;margin-left: 23px">

  But also try to muster up the courage to buy drip/clothing IRL as its easier to sneak something into your
  house if you've packaged it your self. Trust me your average cashier or shop worker will not care and
  will forget about you in the next 30 minutes after serving you. Also if you pay & buy with cash and
  not an online its easier to hide what you've bought! <aniemotwentythree></aniemotwentythree>

  <mark>PLACES NOT RECOMMENED TO SHOP AT ⊘ </mark>

  Etsy.com if your buying skirts it seems to have a lot of cute skirts. But then you do a little digging
  a realise a lot of skirts there are bought of Aliexpress and then resold at a higher price Etsy is
  still great for a lot of things especially more niche or unique stuff but yeah just be careful.
  People drop shipping and tricking you to buying shit at a higher price can happen on any platform
  honestly so always stay vigilant about it.

  Also never shop at Shein there low prices are only low due to child labour or if your financially not
  the best just try not too. here's a video about the company - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv6iK2kS3qQ&list=PLSbFZp8s7tcxaEIlxRCGcBcGPoTL3Bvf6&index=22" target="_blank">Link</a>

  TheBodyShop can look like a simple place that sells cosmetics but really is a well known multi level
  marketing scheme here's a video about it - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6YqZ8-1uwk" target="_blank">Link</a>

  <a href="https://femboysummer.com/" target="_blank">Femboy summer</a> now this site is interesting its the first ever site that seems to market its
  self to femnboys. I feel like us femboys have never had that so the prospect is interesting
  yet id say in its current state its no so good. On the store front a lot of products are
  bought from aliexpress and it seems like a reselling dropping businesses, where they're reselling
  you products you could get for half the price at times if you bought from the original owner.
  Non of the models or pictures on the site are of femboys, so you can't even see what the
  clothes would look like on a male body. They dont guarantee discreet packaging something
  a load of femboys would want. Giving my criticisms to costumer support the person running
  it seems nice enough and i want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but i have to implore
  that the site at the moment is most likely not worth your money. It also sells a load of
  products that are "sissy" or "sexual" that has nothing to do with femboys and looking through
  the products it was me thinking ohh thats cute, but i could probably get it cheaper buying
  it from where it originally came from or looking at these products and feeling really
  disgusted to be honest. So in conclusion in femboy summers current state it sells you stuff and at
  jacked up price with a lack of benefit to the consumer. I want to recommend it cause
  the idea of a store just for femboys is so cool but i cannot and the only thing that its
  good for is finding clothing you can buy on aliexpress most likely and also i can give
  them that some of there clothing selection is kinda cute i guess.

  One day maybe ill add in a guide of my own for shaving but i am not big brain enough for that yet.

  <mark>FITNESS <aniemoseventeen></aniemoseventeen> </mark>

  Now i am not too educated on fitness so i won't say much, but don't go overboard or starve your self just
  think about simply eating less and think about calories in calories out as a important concept and to
  lose weight focus on cardio with.

  • squats

  • crunches

  • sit ups

  • leg stretches

  Mixed with a good diet where you don't eat too much, and keep a calorie deficit

  For me when i started out as a femboy i was too fat to fit into most skirts and i had a waistline
  of 37 inches. I was just slightly above average weight but the idea of cute femboy skirts inspired me
  to work out and improve my weight and fitness. Working out shouldn't be this thing you dread because
  it can be really fun and eventually i lost all that weight and my waistline is around 28 inches now.
  I can fit into medium-sized women size skirts fine and its great but honestly one thing i didn't know
  before getting into fitness was how much your legs would ache pretty much don't work out everyday, you
  need of days to recover. Even if you really enjoy working out don't over do it as you can hurt
  yourself.But that's just my advice from anecdotal experience that i have given because i want to help and
  motivate you but id highly recommend looking up what more qualified people say about fitness and what
  well research scientific evidence says about fitness. Good luck with keeping your self healthy as being
  able to fit into medium size clothing can open up the amount of femboy drip you can wear a lot.

  and squats are key woohoho!

  <mark>FEMININE BODY LANGUAGE</mark>

  What body language is defined as feminine? its is hard to pin down but i feel sitting cross-legged is
  feminine. Putting your ankle together yet your feet apart can also feel feminine, playing with
  your hair can be feminine yet some i have heard can find it flirtatious.

  <mark>SIZING GRAPHS</mark>

  Before becoming a femboy I did not realize how different the average male body was to a female body, especially
  waistline wise average male waistline is around 35 inches while the average female waistline is like
  29 inches. Do you really have to pay attention to sizing here is a chart for skirt sizes.

  <mark>TAKING CUTE PICS</mark>

 <img src="General_Images/cutepictaking1.webp" style="width:425px;height:417px;margin-left: 23px">

  this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/femboymemes/comments/w1as3p/title/" target="_blank">meme</a> by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/n_original_username/" target="_blank">u/n_original_username</a> evidently shows that sometimes taking cute pics can be hard sometimes
  we take a picture look at it and are like damn i am really fucking ugly so here's some just basic
  issues you may be having.

  1. You could just be depressed if you look in the mirror or see a picture of yourself and you
  dont like it that could be just chalked up to depression and less so that those pictures of
  you look ugly.

  2. Maybe it's the angle your taking it at for me i have a hunch taking pictures at a higher
  angle makes my face look better instead of doing a low shot sometimes you just dont look
  as good at certain angles.

  3. Smile! <aniemotwentyseven></aniemotwentyseven> legitimately a smile on your face can just simply make you look cuter, its why everyone
  smiles in photos and people say cheese, its cause a Debbie downer just doesent look as
  attractive as a postive Pat.

  4. Maybe it's the lighting thats bad.

  5. Maybe it's the fit, maybe you just needs some cute clothing to make you feel cute.

  But yeah hopefully that helped trouble shoot the ugliness of your photos cause man, i have
  taken some really hideous photos before i look back on and cringe.

  <mark>MEETING FELLOW FEMBOYS <aniemotwentysix></aniemotwentysix></mark>

  Ok so you've found a femboy online you wanna meet up with amazing! Us femboys hardly ever are able to meet up
  with fellow femboys due to overbearing family or femboys being rare to find regardless if your meeting up with
  one be safe.

  1. Meet in a very public area like a busy train station, a local high street, a town centre or a restaurant.

  2. Reverse image search images of them to make sure there who they say you are.

  3. Tell a close person you trust what your doing. Because you don't want to suddenly fall off the side of the
  earth & nobody knows where the hell you are if you can't tell your parents or gaurdians at least tell a close friend.

  This advice can be used when you meet up with any internet stranger but in short, be safe my fellow femboys.

  <smark>Smuggling in clothing into your house</smark>
  A good idea is to use an Amazon locker and there are services a little like amazon locker but
  for other types of packages or you can send your clothing to a friend's address that may have
  more open-minded parents and is willing to help or if your friend is female/girl, but make sure
  they are a homie & a half To say the least. Amazon lockers, you can get most packages sent to
  them and you can go up to them and your emailed a code to open the locker when the package
  gets to the locker so you can open it. Good luck closeted femboys! <aniemotwentyfour></aniemotwentyfour>

  ok so let's say you've painted your nails excuse you can use i am doing it because i keep biting my 
  nails and this will help me stop doing so

  ok so let's say you have shaved you legs or some part of your body your rebuttal could be that 
  it's ok because <a href="#A9">[5]</a> swimmers do it for muh aerodynamacy and also <a href="#A9">[6]</a> body builders do it, so
  they can show off there muscles more easier and it's a perfectly masculine thing to do another excuse

  <smark>SUBTLE THINGS YOU CAN WEAR THAT WONT INSTANTLY GIVE AWAY YOUR A FEMBOY BUT ARE QUITE FEM</smark>
	
  • a cute hair clip
	
  • wrist warmers
	
  • earrings 

  <smark>How to make DIY thigh highs with like normal materials</smark> (Made by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Oh_look_a_femboy_alt/" target="_blank">u/Oh_look_a_femboy_alt</a>)

  Okay, so you will need:

  • Chalk Needle

  • a thread

  • A pair of thermal trousers

  • black Black socks with a cuff (the slightly thicker but that squeezes more around ur ankle)

  • Cutting implements (I used a scalpel but anything sharp that won't ruin the edge is fine, you want
    clean cuts to its easy to sew)

  Put the thermals on, and get them smooth and comfy. With the chalk, draw a circle around your kneecap,
  for orientation later, a line down the front of your leg and a ring around ur thigh where you wanna cut
  them. Go a little high, too much is better than not enough, you can always roll them down. If you want
  to, put the sock on and keep the line going over it. (I should have mentioned, do these one at a time. It
  should look like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_1.jpg" style="width:412px;height:608px;margin-left: 23px">

  Get the sock, and cut off the "cuff" part, and save it for later. It will be what goes at the top of
  the thigh highs to stop them rolling down.

  Chöp

  The cuff part should look like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_2.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  now, cut around the line on your thigh. I did this while wearing them, be very careful If you are gonna do that.

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_3.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Now, taken off the tube and turn it half inside out, with the top of the thigh the "right way". Put it on your
  leg and match up the knee circle like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_4.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Then pull it up like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_5.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Get it all smooth, and the right height on your thigh (this is important). Roll up the bottom of the leg
  like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_6.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Then put on the sock:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_7.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Then, without moving the whole leg bit, roll down the leg u til its near the top of the sock. Make sure the top
  of the sock isn't rolled over itself. It should look like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_8.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Now, the hard part, sewing. Get the needle threaded, and put it through the leg part, going in at the flat part
  and coming out the rolled edge. Then, put it through the inside edge of the sock and out. What you need to now
  it take in the first stitch. Pull the thread almost all the way through, then tie the needle end and the loose
  end together. Use a double knot, you do NOT want this coming undone. Here's a diagram, if it helps. (This is a
  cross section)

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_9.jpg" style="width:360px;height:292px;margin-left: 23px">

  Now you have tied that (and pulled it tight, but not too tight you do NOT want to bunch up the fabric or snap the
  thread) move along the divide a little, and do that again. You can flip the side you start at each time if you
  want (I.e enter fabric at sock or leg bit). Spacing is ip to you, and how much thread you have. I may sound like
  I know how to do this, but I impulse watched some videos on this a few years ago, and that's the extent of
  knowledge. The pattern should look like this from above:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_10.jpg" style="width:360px;height:245px;margin-left: 23px">

  Do this all the way around, being careful not to unch up the material, and try to keep the stitches even. When
  you get to the point you started, make a stitch, tie it, make another stitch in the same place, thi it with a
  double knot, then cut the thread. (Don't pull it to break it, you could mess up the knot and it would unravel)
  it should look like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_11.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Then, flip the flap over the stitch. This stops the stitches messing with your ankle, and stops your ankle
  messing with the stitches, or your feet tearing them as you put them on.

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_12.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Now, take it off by rolling from the top to the bottom, and put it on the right way around. Your chalk may
  have faded, that's fine.

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_13.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Now, remember that sock cuff bit from earlier? Grab that bish:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_14.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Slide it up, above the thigh highs, and leave it there. Roll down the top of the thigh highs till they look
  like this. (This step both helps the thigh highs stay on and hides any jagged edges)

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_15.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  You will want to orient the side of the cuff that you cut to the tip of the leg part, it makes it neater.
  Using the same method as before, stitch the close sides together. Use closer together stitches for this,
  mine were pretty fragile so I re did them (closer stitches means you will need more thread, keep that in mind)
  After you have done that, flip the cuff part over the folded over bit of the upper leg, and stitch it onto the
  leg part (not the folded bit we are making a little "pocket" that hides the folded bit. And ta-da! You have
  thigh highs, and they are technically talior made for you! The reason for doing everything while wearing them
  is because I have no idea how measurements work and fabric (and thighs) can stretch & squish, so it's hard to
  stitch something to fit. I have no clue how these would hold up in a washing machine, I hand washed mine in a
  sink with warm water and normal clothes soap (I.e the powder that's usually in my washing machine). I probably
  wouldn't washing machine these, it could break the stitches. These do have a left and right side, usually the
  seams are up the inside of your leg, that's how I tell. The chalk should rub off easily.

  Good luck, and if anyone has any suggestions / feedback / questions feel free to message/comment or whatever.
  Enjoy!

  The Result:

  <mark>CREEP DETECTION</mark>

  The sad truth is that us femboys got deal with a load of creeps now here is how to detect em so a person
  messages you first thing just check they're comment history see what they have commented and if they have
  no comment or post history be even more on edge people who have no history or lurkers are most likely being
  creeps on a alt account they never post on and thats why its empty.

  Two if they use kik messenger know it's a place with a lot of shady shit and its more underground then lets
  say discord and it's a favoured place by abusers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sPaJxRmIPc" target="_blank">link</a> here is a video explaining it but if there from kik there
  most likely creep.

  Another thing that makes creeps flock to you is if you but DMs open in your bio or in your Posts that's just a
  creep magnet.

  Another way to spot a creep i if they have a default reddit name there account is more likely to be an alt
  account they only use to be creepy so there main account doesn't get shot down.

  So if their profile isn't clean then be careful but honestly a lot of creeps show there true colours quickly
  say safe out their guys.

  Heres some poll results done by femboys to help you get a better understanding on how femboys
  differ from the rest of society. But keep in mind people can lie on polls so take everything
  with a grain of salt.

  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/femboymemes/comments/x61gxi/stereotype_pol/">Mental Disability in Femboys</a> Around 45% of femboys are mentally disabled now this was an interesting poll
  to do but admittedly responding to some commenters many either didn't know what i meant by
  mentally disabled or interpreted the phrase differently screwing up the poll a bit
  so take it with a pinch of salt but i still feel its significant as 45% is a huge number!

  <mark>HISTORY FEMBOYs</mark>

  The sad truth is most of are history is lost to time to be honest we can see from google trends here.

  <img src="General_Images/google_trends_1.png" style="margin-left: 23px">

  That us femboys on the web started to grow around 2012 around the time r/femboy was created and probably grew  
  from there but then blew up around June 2020 there's this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQAFLyl0DtA/" target="_blank">here</a> but the video is mostly presented in a
  shitpost manner and there's a lack of evidence that backs up any of his assertions so it's hard to trust that
  what he is saying i accurate a lot of femboys and the aeschetic are inspired by the anime trope "trap" so
  it's a moderately logical theory that part of the rise of femboys where to do with the rise of traps
  in anime, <a href="#A9">[4]</a> The modern use of the word may be tracked to the use of the term "trap" or otokonoko on anime image
  boards such as 4chan in the mid-2000s. in 2013 and if thats the truth man hats sad but ehh
  regarding the origin of the terms <a href="#A9">[3]</a> it seems to of come up around the 90s. and originated as a derogatory
  term.

  But from my research its really hard to find tangible evidence to our history if you the reader could give me
  anything including your experiences if your some what of a veteran femboy it would be much appreciated.
<h2 id="C4" style="color:lightpink;"> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <mark>HISTORY OF R/TEENFEMBOY</mark>

  A lot of subreddit history is lost to time but heres the history we do know.

  In around October 2022 there was a sub raid done by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CringetopiaRM/" target="_blank">r/CringetopiaRM</a> when a user made a post insulting a man for
  wearing a jacket with pepe on it, but most users choice more to focus on that the user was a 13 year old femboy
  with thigh pics on the internet. Some had a genuine concern that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teenfemboy/" target="_blank">r/teenfemboy</a> was a breeding ground for nonces
  and that the user was being groomed even though they had no evidence. But many where just homophobic or had
  prejudice against femboys, some even accusing the mod team of this sub of being of old age and child predators!
  in the end one of the moderators on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teenfemboy/" target="_blank">r/teenfemboy</a> got falsely kicked of reddit and the head mod at the time,
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gloomy-Bass/" target="_blank">u/Gloomy-Bass</a> contacted all the other femboy big subreddits and with there help got reddit to help the sub out.
  The sub went into a full lock down around October 7th and new rules where put in so reddit wouldn't consider
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teenfemboy/" target="_blank">r/teenfemboy</a> as "sexualising minors" and now rules are much more stricter on suggestive content to keep the
  subreddit afloat some where annoyed by the changes but most accepted them understanding the circumstances when
  discussing it with moderators.

  Since then the subreddits been chugging along getting a new icon on the 15th of October and now the subreddit
  has a tradition of changing the subs logo for seasonal holidays or events.

  And so far that is the subreddits history at least the history that is been remembered and now its to be
  continued...
